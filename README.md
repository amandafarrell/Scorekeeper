# Scorekeeper
Simple, multiplayer scorekeeper



-Add players with the floating action button

-Long press to edit a player's name or to delete the player

-Tap on a player to add or subtract points

-Use the menu to reset all scores or delete all players



These actions are all fairly simple to implement because this app is built on a SQLite database.
